// try to solve the questions as soon as possible with the help of brute force
// it may take O(n) but do it
// in this question we can use the binary search twice
// in the first time we will run the binary search to find the first occurrence  of the target element -- first index
// 2nd time  for the last index of the target element
//Steps :
// 1] NORMAL BINARY SEARCH
// 2] THE CONDITION WHERE THE TARGET == ARR[MID] -- APLY BINARY SEARCH THERE
// THIS WILL GIVE THE 1ST INDEX OF THE TARGET ELEMENT
// IN THE INTERVIEWS --- THERE WONT BE ANY USE OF IDE SO NO AUTO COMPLETION
// WE NEED TO PRACTICE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN LEETCODE WITHOUT ANY AUTO COMPLETE
