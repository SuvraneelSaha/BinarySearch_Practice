// WHAT DO WE MEAN BY CEILING OF A GIVEN NO.
// in this array find the smallest no. that is greater than or equal to the target element
// ans >= target element
// PS : Target element will be given
// CRUCIAL STEPS FOR DOING THE CEILING PROBLEM
// 1] WHAT THE TARGET ELEMENT IS
// 2] FIND ALL THE NOS WHICH ARE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE TARGET
// 3]WHICH IS THE SMALLEST NO. AMONG THE NUMBERS WHICH ARE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE TARGET ELEMENT
